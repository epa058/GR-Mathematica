# GR Mathematica

This project presents a simple Mathematica program designed to automate important calculations in differential geometry and general relativity. The Mathematica code features a user-friendly interface that accepts any arbitrary metric tensor and efficiently computes and outputs the following:
- Christoffel Symbols
- Riemann Curvature Tensor
- Ricci Tensor
- Ricci Scalar
- Einstein Tensor
- Geodesic Equations

This package was originally developed for a class in general relativity (PHYS 514 at McGill University), where it proved to be an invaluable tool, helping me with assignments.
